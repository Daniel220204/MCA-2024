The primary challenges in working with music data stem from restricted access, inconsistent curation, and fragmented distribution, all of which make it difficult to fully analyze and engage with music comprehensively.

Week 2
For this week's assignment, I transcribed a piano arrangement of "Moon" by Kanye West. These are screenshots of the transcript.

Task 2: A comparison of the elements of MusicXML and MEI reveals significant differences in the way they represent music data. Firstly, there is a difference in the representation of musical notes; MusicXML uses the <note> element with its sub-elements <pitch> and <duration> to provide richer semantic information, but MEI shows a more concise structure by using <pname> and <oct> in the <note> element. Secondly, for the representation of time signatures, MusicXML uses the <time> element and its sub-elements <beats> and <beat-type>, while MEI uses the <meterSig> element and its corresponding attributes, and although both convey the same information, the structure of MusicXML is a bit more flexible. Finally, for key signatures, MusicXML expresses them through the <key> element with its sub-elements <fifths> and <mode>, but MEI uses the <keySig> element to express the same. This difference results in MusicXML being better suited for reading, while MEI is better suited for quick parsing. Therefore, when choosing between using MusicXML and MEI, the choice of which to use should be based on the needs of the project.

Time-frequency analysis is more helpful than just looking at waveforms because it shows not only the loudness of the music but also which tones or pitches are present at any moment. For example, in the spectrogram of Another Moon, the bright yellow and orange areas show where the loudest and most prominent sounds are, like deep bass or higher-pitched melodies. This gives a clearer picture of how the music changes over time, like when a soft section builds into a louder, more intense part. You can’t see these details in the waveform, which only shows overall loudness without telling you what kind of sounds are playing.

Analysis:
The MFCC histograms for the three tracks highlight both similarities and differences. "Another Moon" and "Moonlight Reprise" have smoother and more balanced patterns, reflecting their calm and consistent sound.  In contrast, "Moonrise" shows more peaks and variations, which align with its more dynamic and intense sound.  The visual differences in the histograms match the tracks' audio characteristics, with "Moonrise" being more energetic and layered, while the other two tracks feel more relaxed and steady.

Analysis:
The transcription from the original to the recreated one captures the basic structure, including the rhythmic framework and primary tonal content.  However, significant musical details are lost, such as dynamics, articulations, and pedal markings, which are essential for expression.  Rhythmic complexities and polyphonic voice separation are often oversimplified or inaccurate, leading to misrepresented note groupings.  While the transcription is a useful starting point, it requires substantial manual refinement to accurately reflect the original piece's musical nuance.
